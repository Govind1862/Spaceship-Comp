# Spaceship-Comp

A data science / machine learning project (in Jupyter Notebook) to perform classification / prediction for spacecraft data.  
(“Spaceship-Comp” is short for “Spaceship Competition” / “Spaceship Classification”)

## About

This project aims to build a model to classify or predict outcomes related to spaceships (or a “spaceship competition” dataset). The core work is done in a Jupyter notebook and uses standard Python / ML libraries (e.g. pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).  

Features / goals include:  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Model training & validation  
- Submission / inference on test data  

---

## Dataset

The repository includes data files:  
- `train.csv` — the training set  
- `test.csv` — the test set on which predictions are made  
- `sample_submission.csv` — sample format for submission  
- `submission.csv` — (your output predictions)  

You should verify columns, features, target variables, and data distributions by inspecting the notebook.

- `Spaceship_Comp.ipynb`: the primary Jupyter notebook guiding through data loading, EDA, modeling, and predictions  
- CSV files: datasets and submission files  
- (Any scripts or additional helper files, if you have them, can go into subfolders like `src/` or `notebooks/`)

## Installation & Setup

To work on this project locally, you can set it up as follows (example with `venv`):

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Govind1862/Spaceship-Comp.git
cd Spaceship-Comp

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
